# AI Course Repository

**Purpose of this course:** This repository serves as a collection of projects and implementations undertaken during the AI course at North East University Bangladesh. It aims to demonstrate understanding of various AI algorithms, their applications in games, and exploration of AI tools.

**What I learned from this course:** Throughout this course, I gained practical experience in implementing fundamental AI algorithms such as search algorithms (BFS, DFS, Best-First Search), adversarial search (Min-Max, Alpha-Beta Pruning), and informed search (AO\*). I also applied these concepts to develop AI-powered games like Nim and Tic-Tac-Toe. Furthermore, the course provided insights into the capabilities and usage of modern AI tools for content creation.

**Duration of this course:** Spring 2025, 5th Semester.

**Course Teacher :** Mr. Razorshi Prozzwal Talukder

### **Algorithm Implementation**

This folder contains the implementations of various AI algorithms.

- `alpha_beta_pruning.py`
- `ao_star.py`
- `beam_search.py`
- `best_first_search.py`
- `bfs.py`
- `bidirectional_search.py`
- `deepening_search.py`
- `depth_limited_search.py`
- `dfs.py`
- `heuristic_search.py`
- `min_max.py`

**Note:** Each algorithm file includes a `Readme` section within its respective file or a separate `README.md` file (to be added) detailing:
_ How the algorithm works
_ Applications of the algorithm
_ Complexity analysis
_ Images of input and output (where applicable)

### **AI Games**

This folder hosts AI-powered game implementations.

- `nim.py`
- `tictactoe.py`

**Note:** Each game will have a dedicated `Readme` file (e.g., `nim/README.md`, `tictactoe/README.md`) providing:
_ How to run the game file
_ Any required pre-installed software, libraries, or frameworks
_ Instructions on how to play the game
_ Images/screenshots of the game
_ Which AI algorithm is used for the game
_ Source codes in proper format with comments.

### **AI Tools Exploration**

This folder contains deliverables demonstrating the exploration and use of AI tools.

This includes:

- A video (at least 1 minute duration) about the AI course, created using AI tools. This video combines theoretical concepts learned and practical lab tasks (algorithms & games).
- A presentation slide deck (10-12 slides) on the AI course, also created using AI tools. This presentation covers both theoretical knowledge and lab tasks.
