# AI Course Repository

---

**Purpose of this course:**
This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects, implementations, and deliverables from the AI course at North East University Bangladesh. It demonstrates practical understanding of core AI algorithms, their application in games, and the use of modern AI tools for content creation and presentation.

**What I learned from this course:**

- Implemented and analyzed fundamental AI algorithms (BFS, DFS, Best-First Search, Min-Max, Alpha-Beta Pruning, AO\*).
- Developed AI-powered games (Nim, Tic-Tac-Toe) using these algorithms.
- Explored and utilized AI tools for creating presentations and videos.
- Gained hands-on experience in applying theoretical concepts to practical problems.

**Duration of this course:**
Spring 2025, 5th Semester.

**Supervisor / Course Teacher:**
Mr. Razorshi Prozzwal Talukder

### **Algorithm Implementation**

This folder contains the implementations of various AI algorithms.

- `alpha_beta_pruning.py`
- `ao_star.py`
- `beam_search.py`
- `best_first_search.py`
- `bfs.py`
- `bidirectional_search.py`
- `deepening_search.py`
- `depth_limited_search.py`
- `dfs.py`
- `heuristic_search.py`
- `min_max.py`

**Note:** Each algorithm file includes a `Readme` section within its respective file or a separate `README.md` file (to be added) detailing:
_ How the algorithm works
_ Applications of the algorithm
_ Complexity analysis
_ Images of input and output (where applicable)

### **AI Games**

This folder hosts AI-powered game implementations.

- `chess.py`
- `nim.py`
- `tictactoe.py`

**Note:** Each game has a dedicated `Readme` file (e.g., `Chess/README.md`, `Nim/README.md`, `TicTacToe/README.md`) providing:
_ How to run the game file
_ Any required pre-installed software, libraries, or frameworks
_ Instructions on how to play the game
_ Images/screenshots of the game
_ Which AI algorithm is used for the game
_ Source codes in proper format with comments.
